Hi, I'm Jeevan

I am learning and build AI agents and ship working examples that anyone can use.

Most of my work is hands-on: real code, clear patterns, and tested setups for AI Agents, Multi-agent teams, RAG, tool calling, memory, and local and cloud LLM Apps.

I run the open-source Awesome LLM Apps, the repo where I drop complete agent templates, clean starter kits, and advanced demos that help devs skip the noise and get straight to building.

What I am working on
AI Agents: single-agent, multi-agent, MCP-based, browser agents
