# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeevan

I build and share **AI Agents** — practical, working examples that anyone can use.  
Most of my work is **hands-on**, focusing on **samples, tested setups, and real-world integrations** across:

- 🧠 AI Agents (single & multi-agent systems)  
- 🔗 MCP-based and tool-calling frameworks  
- 🌐 Browser and environment-aware agents  
- 📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- **AI Agents:** single-agent, multi-agent, and MCP-driven designs  
- **Tool Use & Orchestration:** connecting agents to real-world APIs and systems  
- **Browser Agents:** building practical examples for automation and decision-making
